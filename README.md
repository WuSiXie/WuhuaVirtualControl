# WuhuaVirtualControl  
A windows driver which can create a virtual Joystick based on Microsoft VHF lib.  
To biuld this project, the latest Visual Studio, WindowsSDK and WindowsWDK are requierd.  
There are still some known issues in the project.  
I know how to fix them. but it's too late tonight.  
  1.The driver can not unload safty(I didn't even write the unload function).  
  2.The test program has some bugs. But I think it's doesn't matters(at least that thing works).   
And last thing last. I got some inspiration from https://github.com/Bingauui/Virtual-Gaming-Control
