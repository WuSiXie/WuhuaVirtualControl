# WuhuaVirtualControl\n
A windows driver which can create a virtual Joystick based on Microsoft VHF lib.\n
There are still some known issues in the project.\n
I know how to fix them. but it's too late tonight.\n
  1.The driver can not unload safty(I didn't even write the unload function).\n
  2.The test program has some bugs. But I think it's doesn't matters(at least that thing works). \n
